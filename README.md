Just a simple emulator for the CDP-1802 microprocessor in a particular configuration.


# Usage

This program must be run from the same directory as the `data` subfolder.

Windows:
`1802emu.exe rom.bin`

Linux:
`./1802emu rom.bin`

Should otherwise be fairly straightforward.

# Compiling

To compile this you will need to install Raylib (https://www.raylib.com) and GNU Make.
